    "# Springboard: Logistic Regression Advanced Case Study\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study we introduce the <b>Logistic Regression</b> algorithm, which can be used to build models that are  simple and yet effecive--in some cases. This algorithm can be used to build useful baseline models for classification problems that can be easily interpreted. For these reasons, <b>Logistic Regression</b> is considered as one of the fundamental Machine Learning algorithms associated with classification problems.\n",

    "Classification tries to predict which of a set of classes an observation belongs to, where classes are things like \"dog or cat\". Mathematically, the aim is to find a model $G(X, y)$ where $X$ is a matrix of features constructed from the data, and $y$ is a vector of class labels associated with each row (instance) in $X$, such that the model $G$ does a good job predicting classes given new data $X'$. For instance, consider a doctor trying to assess whether a paitent has heart disease and needs treatment. In this case, the classes are \"has heart disease\" or \"does not have heart disease\". To have a machine do this well, we would typically feed the machine a set of data about prior patients along with whether they had heart disease (determined by some other examinations or tests), and *train* the model with the *features* (things observed about the patients, like age, weight, etc.) and the *labels* (whether the patient had heart disease). Then, given the same observations (i.e. the same features) for a *new* patient, the trained model returns the class associated with such observations, which can be used as a predictor of whether the person has heart disease or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea on which the Logistic Regression algorithm is based is shown schematically in the image below, for a simple case of two features (a.k.a. 2-D feature space). In its simpler form, the algorithm tries to find a line that divides \"things\" of two different types in this 2-D feature space. Such a line is usually called a decision boundary, but in general, the decision boundary might have a more complex form, and be in a higher dimensional space (that isn't easily represented in a 2-D chart). Of course, in reality most problems are more complex and are modeled with more than 2 dimensions, as we will see in this Case Study.\n",

For example, we have already completed Step One--the problem is to use machine learning to help doctors asses whether a paitent has heart disease or not, using information from examinations. Also, we noted we removed some cases with missing values, as a brief version of Step Two. Importantly, we've will highly abbreviate Step Three--EDA. In most projects you would want to spend considerable time on EDA. Step Four will be addressed as we deal with categorial variables later and split the data into training, validation, and test sets. Most of your time in the Case Study will be spend on Step Five, Modeling. In a complete project, you would often prepare a report or some presentation materials for Step Six, but will not do that here.\n",

Depending upon the models you choose to apply to these data, some additional preparation might be in order, such as ensuring the non-categorical values are all in sensible ranges (such as, what is a feasbile maximum value for cholesterol?), possibly scaling some of the variables, and generally ensuring you understand the data and they are suitable for a given model, to mention only a few.

    "For a binary classification problem (two classes), the problem is called *balanced* if the number of elements of each class is about the same--in other words, each class would have a size that is about 50% of the total number of elements in the dataset. In this particular case study, one would say that this problem is slightly imbalanced, since the difference in the percentages is about 10%. When there is a imbalance among the classes in a binary classification problem, one usually refers to them as the *minority class*, and the *majority class*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, *Imbalanced Classification Problems* (ICP) are very common in situations where one is modeling events that are not common, and thus these events would be instances of the *minority* class. Examples of these problems include: study of diseases such as Cancer, study of processes such as fraud, and--in general--the study of rare anomalies within a system. It is common to find instances of these problems where the difference in the percentages is 80% or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two important challenges posed by ICPs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The difference in the size of the classes is *inherent* to the problem under study. This means that one cannot pave this difference by adding more elements to the minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classification algorithms are usually negatively affected by the lack of sufficient samples of the minority class, in that the models built with them are practically unable to differentiate the minority class from the majority class, where the former is the one of interest. For instance, imagine a model built to compute the likelihod of a patient developing Cancer that nearly always predicts a small likelihood for this class (meaning, that the model predicts NO Cancer, when it should have predicted Cancer in some cases).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this particular case study deals with a slight imbalance among the classes, we might be able to build useful models with the given dataset--without introducing additional interventions. One general approach to deal with ICP is by either generating sythetic data (a.k.a. *oversampling*), or by generating a set of smaller \"majority classes\" by taking chunks from the original majority class (a.k.a. *undersampling*). In general, these approaches are collectively referred to as *resampling*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not practice these concepts in this case study, but you might have the opportinity to do so in your capstone projects. Discuss this possibility with your mentor if/when applicable.\n",
    "\n",

    "In this case, the test accuracy is sometimes better, but not by very much--a maximum difference of no more than 0.15 units.  We've already noted that accuracy isn't always a good measure of model performance, and shown the use of the confusion matrix. Additional performance measures are provided by sklearn in the ``classifcation_report`` method (ref: [sklearn.metrics.classification_report](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html), including ``precision``, ``recall``, and ``f1-score``.  Note that if desired, we could graph multiple classification performance metrics similarly to the accuracy difference plot above. We won't do a deep dive on metrics here, but below we use the ``classification_report`` method to demonstrate the additional metrics. Note that since we didn't store the intermediate models, the following outputs results from the last of the 25 trials performed."

    "We've just seen that the scikit-learn logistic regression model has some adjustable parameters (*hyperparameters*) we can tune to optimize performance. Keep in mind that optimizing performance means we want to minimize the gap between the model performance on the training set and the test/validation set. It's possible to get a very good score on the training set but do poorly on the test set, due to what is called \"overfitting'.  Overfitting refers to the case where the training performance is significantly higer than the test performance--this is caused by the model \"memorizing\" the training data. For tuning the parameters of your model, you will use a mix of *cross-validation* and *grid search*. In Logistic Regression, the most important parameter to tune is the *regularization parameter* ``C``. The regularization parameter is used to control for unlikely high regression coefficients, by adding a \"penalty\" to the loss term when the coefficients get larger.  For sklearn ``LogisticRegression``, ``C`` is the \"inverse regularization strength\", meaning smaller ``C`` constrains the paramters more. Also note that the actual penalty is determined by the \"penalty\" paramter, which defaults to ``l2``. l2 regularization uses a value ($\\lambda$) multipled by the sum of the squares of the model coefficients.  l1 regularization multiples $\\lambda$ by the sum of the absolute values of the weights. l2 is also called Ridge regularization (see section 3.4 and equation 3.41 in [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/ESLII.pdf)) and l1 is called Lasso regularization (see section 3.4 and equation 3.52, ibid).  So by default, smaller values of ``C`` will result in l2 regularization with larger $\\lambda$ and a greater penalty on the larger model coefficients. Lastly, note that the default value for ``C`` is 1, and along with the default penaly l2, means scikit-learn Logistic Regression *always* uses regularization. If you would like to build Logistic Regression models without regularization, you can use statsmodels (*).\n",

    "Cross Validation refers to using a procedure to split the data into multiple train/validation splits, fitting a model using the training split, computing the performance metrics for the validation split over multiple splits. The metrics are typically averaged and the average value is reported as hopefully representative of what the model will do in the future on new data. Recall earlier we showed that across 25 splits the train and the test scores varied; a key idea behind cross validation is to avoid choosing a \"lucky\" split that happens to give great performance on the data at hand but does more poorly later.  Since the scores vary across random splits, it's assumed that the best score or the worst score aren't as likely to represent the future as an average. Some Data Scientists also report the standard deviation of the cv scores as a further measure of how confident they are in the score.\n",

    "We use the following `cv_score` function to perform K-fold cross-validation and apply a scoring function to each test fold. A *fold* in this case just means a different split of the data, in this case random splits. The function generates five different splits (i.e. 5-fold validation), fits a classifier each time (note that the classifier is passed as a parameter to the function, so we can define it as anything that has a ``fit`` and ``predict`` method), and computes the \"score\", which by default is ``accuracy_score``. (Note the use of accuracy as the scoring metric--do you think this is the best approach for this problem?) Kfold is used to return sets of indices vs. the actual data, so the indices are generated, split, and passed as the vectors train, test to define the actual x and y data used on each pass. The scores are summed up in ``result``, and then the average is returned.\n",

In other words, we wish to find the \"regression\" line which divides the samples. Now, a line has the form $w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_0 = 0$ in 2-dimensions. On one side of this line we have \n",
    "\n",
    "$$w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_0 \\ge 0,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and on the other side we have \n",
    "\n",
    "$$w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_0 < 0.$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Our classification rule then becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "y = 1\\;\\; &if&\\; \\textbf{w}\\cdot\\textbf{x} \\ge 0\\\\\n",
    "y = 0\\;\\; &if&\\; \\textbf{w}\\cdot\\textbf{x} < 0\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ \\textbf{x}$ is the vector $\\{1,x_1, x_2,...,x_n\\}$ where we have also generalized to more than 2 features.\n",
    "\n",
    "What hypotheses $h$ can we use to achieve this? One way to do so is to use the **sigmoid** function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that at $z=0$ this function has the value 0.5. If $z > 0$, $h > 0.5$ and as $z \\to \\infty$, $h \\to 1$. If $z < 0$, $h < 0.5$ and as $z \\to -\\infty$, $h \\to 0$. As long as we identify any value of $y > 0.5$ as 1, and any $y < 0.5$ as 0, we can achieve what we wished above.\n",

    "Remember we said earlier that if $h > 0.5$ we ought to identify the sample with $y=1$? One way of thinking about this is to identify $h({w}\\cdot{x})$ with the probability that the sample is a '1'  $\\;$($y=1$). Then we have the intuitive notion that lets identify a sample as 1 if we find that the probabilty of being a '1' is $\\;\\ge 0.5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So suppose we say then that the probability of $y=1$ for a given $\\textbf{x}$ is given by $h(\\textbf{w}\\cdot\\textbf{x})$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the conditional probabilities of $y=1$ or $y=0$ given a particular sample's features $\\v{x}$ are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "P(y=1 | \\textbf{x}) &=& h(\\textbf{w}\\cdot\\textbf{x}) \\\\\n",
    "P(y=0 | \\textbf{x}) &=& 1 - h(\\textbf{w}\\cdot\\textbf{x}).\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\n",
    "These two can be written together as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(y|\\textbf{x}, \\textbf{w}) = h(\\textbf{w}\\cdot\\textbf{x})^y \\left(1 - h(\\textbf{w}\\cdot\\textbf{x}) \\right)^{(1-y)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then multiplying over the samples we get the probability of the training $y$ given $\\textbf{w}$ and the $\\textbf{x}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(y|\\textbf{x},\\textbf{w}) = P(\\{y_i\\} | \\{\\textbf{x}_i\\}, \\textbf{w}) = \\prod_{y_i \\in \\cal{D}} P(y_i|\\textbf{x_i}, \\textbf{w}) = \\prod_{y_i \\in \\cal{D}} h(\\textbf{w}\\cdot\\textbf{x_i})^{y_i} \\left(1 - h(\\textbf{w}\\cdot\\textbf{x_i}) \\right)^{(1-y_i)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use probabilities? Earlier, we talked about how the regression function $f(x)$ never gives us the $y$ exactly, because of noise. This hold for classification too. Even with identical features, a different sample may be classified differently. \n",
    "\n",
    "We said that another way to think about a noisy $y$ is to imagine that our data $\\mathcal{D}$ was generated from  a joint probability distribution $P(x,y)$. Thus we need to model $y$ at a given $x$, written as $P(y|x)$, and since $P(x)$ is also a probability distribution, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x,y) = P(y | x) P(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and can obtain our joint probability $P(x, y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed its important to realize that a particular training set can be thought of as a draw from some \"true\" probability distribution (just as we did when showing the hairy variance diagram). If for example the probability of classifying a test sample as a '0' was 0.1, and it turns out that the test sample was a '0', it does not mean that this model was necessarily wrong. After all, in roughly a 10th of the draws, this new sample would be classified as a '0'! But, of-course its more unlikely than its likely, and having good probabilities means that we'll be likely right most of the time, which is what we want to achieve in classification. And furthermore, we can quantify this accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus its desirable to have probabilistic, or at the very least, ranked models of classification where you can tell which sample is more likely to be classified as a '1'. There are business reasons for this too. Consider the example of customer \"churn\": you are a cell-phone company and want to know, based on some of my purchasing habit and characteristic \"features\" if I am a likely defector. If so, you'll offer me an incentive not to defect. In this scenario, you might want to know which customers are most likely to defect, or even more precisely, which are most likely to respond to incentives. Based on these probabilities, you could then spend a finite marketing budget wisely."

What the classifier does is very intuitive: if the probability is greater than 0.5, it classifies the sample as type '1' (has heart disease), otherwise it classifies the sample to be class '0' (no heart disease). Thus in the diagram above, where we have plotted predicted values rather than actual labels of samples, there is a clear demarcation at the 0.5 probability line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this notion of trying to obtain the line or boundary of demarcation is what is called a **discriminative** classifier. The algorithm tries to find a decision boundary that separates those who have heart disease from those who do not. To classify a new sample, it checks on which side of the decision boundary the sample falls, and makes a prediction. In other words we are asking, given $\\textbf{x}$, what is the probability of a given $y$, or, what is the likelihood $P(y|\\textbf{x},\\textbf{w})$?"
